# SmartSensorPython
MicroPython Code for playing with microcontroller especially to experiment with M5stack devices

This example shows how to push data to external portal once montion is detected. I have used blynk for this project.

**What you will need:**
1. M5stack device ( M5sstick, M5Stack Core , M5Atom)
2. Firmware burned to device (Refer to M5stack documentation : https://docs.m5stack.com/en/products)
3. Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) motion sensor to detect human motion
4. blynk account to upload data from device to blynk server (https://blynk.io/)
5. blynk API credentials
